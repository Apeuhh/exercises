Steps marked with ✔️ are verifications that all is working as expected and that you can keep running through the exercise.

The purpose of this exercise is to build a minimalist web application (TODO list), using *spring-mvc* for the HTTP part and *spring-data-jdbc* for the data persistence part.

== Prerequisites

* Install Git (cf https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* (On Windows, have a posix terminal, such as **Git Bash**)
* Configure Git with your name and email
** `git config --global user.name "John Doe"`
** `git config --global user.email johndoe@example.fr`
* If not existing, generate an SSH key and give the public part to GitHub (cf https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/)

* Install JDK 17 (cf https://adoptium.net/)
* ✔️ `javac -version` and `java -version` command should display the version **17**

* Install Maven (cf https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
* ✔️ `mvn -version` command should display version *3.8.6* or higher

* Install IntelliJ Community (cf https://www.jetbrains.com/fr-fr/idea/download)

* Install Docker and Docker Compose V2 (Docker Desktop for Windows and Mac)

== Part 1 - Repository creation using a template

* On the template page https://github.com/lernejo/maven_starter_template, click on "Use this template"
* Fill in the repository name: **web_app_spring_training**
* Check the repository as **private**
* Create the repository by clicking on "*Create repository from template*"
* Invite the current teacher as a read-only member (for grading)
* Do not forget to update badges (follow
  -> https://github.com/lernejo/exercises/blob/master/maven_fr/EXERCISE.adoc#partie-6---live-badges)
* Clone this new repository using the *SSH URL*
* The default branch is *main*, and the exercise will be graded on this branch

== Part 2 - BOM & Dependencies

[NOTE]
====
A BOM (**B**ill **O**f **M**aterials) is a list of libraries and frameworks for which versions are compatible.

As the Java ecosystem evolves fast, breaking changes (method or class removed, etc.) frequently happen.

That is why the biggest frameworks (such as Spring-Boot) publish BOM to ensure that all dependencies of a project work well with each other.
====

* In the *pom.xml* file, add Spring-Boot BOM in the `<dependencyManagement>` section

[source,xml]
----
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-dependencies</artifactId>
            <version>2.7.4</version>
            <scope>import</scope>
            <type>pom</type>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
----

* Add the interesting dependency in the `<dependencies>` section

[source,xml]
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
        <!--1-->
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

<1> The version is not filled because it is handled by the BOM

== Part 3 - HTTP Endpoints

We will code two HTTP endpoints which will allow to

* Get the list of notes
* Add a new note

First, the state will be set in memory using an `java.util.ArrayList`.

Spring-mvc supply numerous annotations to point out the role of specific class or method to the framework.
In our case, here are the interesting ones:

* `@RestController` : mark a class as being a _controller_ (HTTP adapter)
* `@GetMapping` : mark a method as handling a *GET* HTTP request
* `@PostMapping` : mark a method as handling a *POST* HTTP request
* `@RequestBody` : mark a method parameter for injection with the content of the HTTP request body, handling serialization (transforming raw text into a Java object)

* Create a record `fr.lernejo.todo.Todo` with two parameters `message` and `author`
* Create a class `fr.lernejo.todo.TodoListController`
* Add two methods in this last class, one to add a `Todo` in the list, another to get the list
* Annotate these methods so that they match the following requests:
** *POST* /api/todo
** *GET* /api/todo
* Create a class `fr.lernejo.todo.TodoListApp` annotée avec `@SpringBootApplication`
* Add a `main` method with the following content: `SpringApplication.run(TodoListApp.class, args);`
* Run the application using the `main` method, by default the server launched by the framework listens on the 8080 port
* ✔️ Check that the two endpoints behave as expected using an HTTP client (browser, curl, etc.)
* Add and commit these files

== Part 4 - A filter to add an HTTP header

If our application is scaled horizontally, we will need to identify by which instance a given request is handled.
To this end, we will create a filter which will add a header *Instance-Id* to each HTTP response.

[NOTE]
====
A filter is a component implementing the `javax.servlet.Filter` interface, and will be used at the arrival of every request.

It implements the *Chain of Responsibility* pattern, and its role (as a link) is to perform an operation and [.underline]#hand over to the next filter#:

[source,java]
----
chain.doFilter(request, response);
----

A filter can also decide to interrupt the chain, in this case, the HTTP response will be sent as it is.
====

* Create a class `fr.lernejo.todo.ApplicationIdentifierFilter` implementing the `javax.servlet.Filter` interface and annotated with `@Component`
* Generate a random `UUID` in this class constructor and store its `String` representation in a field of the class
* In the implementation of the `doFilter` method, add the header *Instance-Id* with the random UUID value to the response before calling the next filter.

To do this, the response object should be casted to the `javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse` type, which has a `setHeader` method.

[NOTE]
====
The pattern-matching is a flow control tool allowing to have different execution branches depending on the type of an object.

In Java, this feature is under construction.

However, some parts are already usable, especially to avoid an explicit _downcast_:

[source,java]
----
public void myMethod(Object myParam) {
    if (myParam instanceof String myString) {
        // <1>
    }
}
----
<1> The `myString` variable is of type `String`. The execution will not go inside the `if` bloc if the given parameter is not a `String`
====

* ✔️ Start the application and check that the *Instance-Id* header is set
* ✔️ Multiple calls should return the same header, however if the application is restarted, it will change
* Add and commit the changes

== Part 5 - Docker image of our application & Docker Compose

Docker is a tool allowing to run containers based on images.

Images themselves are archives containing the required/wanted binaries (OS, tools, application, etc.).

Docker Compose is a container orchestrator, able to manage, consistently, from the same descriptor file, a set of containers.

* Add in the `<build>` section of the *pom.xml* file the following content:

[source,xml]
----
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>2.7.4</version>
            <executions>
                <execution>
                    <goals>
                        <goal>repackage</goal> <!--1-->
                    </goals>
                </execution>
            </executions>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
----

<1> The goal *repackage* is this plugin supplied by Spring-Boot will replace the jar created by the *maven-jar-plugin* by an auto-executable one, containing also the code of the dependencies

// -

* Create a *Dockerfile* file at the root of the project (next to the *pom.xml* file)
* Paste in it the following content:

[source,Docker]
----
# <1>
FROM maven:3.8.3-openjdk-17 AS build
COPY src /home/app/src
COPY pom.xml /home/app
# <2>
RUN mvn -f /home/app/pom.xml clean package

# <3>
FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jdk-focal
# <4>
COPY --from=build /home/app/target/maven_training-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar /usr/local/lib/app.jar
# <5>
EXPOSE 8080
ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","/usr/local/lib/app.jar"]
----

<1> Image containing Maven, used to build the project in a "*build*" step
<2> Project jar packaging
<3> Base image used for the final image, not containing Maven
<4> It can be necessary to change the name of the archive, if the name or the version of the project have been changed
<5> The application listens on the 8080 port, and this information is filled in to be able to handle network configuration and port forwarding

// -

* Create a *docker-compose.yml* file at the root of the project
* Paste in it the following content:

[source,yml]
----
version: "3.9"
services:
  todolist:
    build : . # <1>
    ports:
      - 8081:8080 # <2>
----

<1> Use the *Dockerfile* int the same directory
<2> Forward the 8081 port of the host (left) to the 8080 port of the container (right)

// -

* Start the app with the `docker compose up -d` command
* ✔️ Check that the service is available (GET http://localhost:8081/api/todo)
* Add and commit the changes

== Part 6 - Scaling and load-balancing

We are now setting upa load-balancer to distribute the HTTP traffic on several instances of our application.

* In the *docker-compose.yml* file, add the following content under the service tag:

[source,yml]
----
traefik:
    image: traefik:2.5
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 80:80
      - 8080:8080
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
      - ./traefik.toml:/traefik.toml
----

* Create a *traefik.toml* file at the root of the project with the following content:

[source,toml]
----
[global]
  sendAnonymousUsage = false

[accessLog]

[log]
  level = "DEBUG"
  format = "common"

[providers]
  [providers.docker]
    endpoint = "unix:///var/run/docker.sock"
    watch = true
    exposedByDefault = true
    swarmMode = false

[api]
  dashboard = true
  debug = false
  insecure = true

[entryPoints]
  [entryPoints.insecure]
    address = ":80"
----

[NOTE]
====
Traefik comes with a dashboard available at http://localhost:8080.
The *8080* port is used for the administration, whereas the *80* port is used for service.
When Traefik uses the Docker _provider_, the routing configuration is inferred from the labels set on services declared in Docker Compose.
====

* The the following labels to the *todolist* servive in the *docker-compose.yml* file:

[source,yml]
----
labels:
- "traefik.http.routers.todolist.rule=PathPrefix(`/app`)"
- "traefik.http.middlewares.todolist.stripPrefix.prefixes=/app"
- "traefik.http.routers.todolist.middlewares=todolist@docker"
----

* Start the various containers using the `docker compose up -d` command
* ✔️ Check that the service is available at http://localhost:80/app/api/todo

[NOTE]
====
A same port cannot be listened to by more than one process.
If a port of the host is fixed in the configuration of a Docker Compose service, this service cannot be scaled using the _replica_ feature.
====

* Delete the hardcoded port of the host in the *todolist* service in the *docker-compose.yml* file
* Add the following configuration to the same service so Docker will start 3 instances:

[source,yml]
----
deploy:
  replicas: 3
----

* Start the various containers using the `docker compose up -d` command
* ✔️ Check that the *Instance-Id* header takes 3 distinct values, whatever the number of HTTP calls
* Add and commit the changes

== Part 7 - Database persistence

Until now, the state of the application is stored in memory, so when the application is restarted, every dta is lost.
Furthermore, when having multiple instances behind a load-balancer, the state appear inconsistent, as it depend on the instance the HTTP request is routed to.

This kinf of application is said _stateful_ (having a state), is not compatible with horizontal scaling.

In this case, we will transform it into a _stateless_ application (having no state), by pushing the state further away.

It exists multiple solutions to share a state between distinct instances (brokers, cache, databases, shared memory API such as Hazelcast, etc.)

In this exercise, we will store the state in a PostgreSQL database.

* Add the following dependencies in the pom.xml file

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jdbc</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.postgresql</groupId>
    <artifactId>postgresql</artifactId>
    <version>42.5.0</version>
</dependency>
----

* Create a *application.yml* file in the *src/main/resources* directory with the following content:

[source,yml]
----
spring:
  sql.init.mode: always # <1>
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432,postgres:5432/postgres
    username: postgres
    password: example
----
<1> Allows to execute the *schema.sql* file at application startup

* Create in the same directory a *schema.sql* file with the following content:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS todo (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    message TEXT,
    author CHAR(64)
);
----

* Create a class `fr.lernejo.todo.TodoEntity` annotated with `@Table("todo")`
* Add to it 3 fields _publics_ _mutables_
** `Long id` annotated with `@Id`
** `String message`
** `String author`

[NOTE]
====
Current persistence libraries (Spring-data, Hibernate, etc.) work with _entities_ which are projections as objects of the data stored in database.

(JPA) Entities, are expected by these libraries to be mutable, and have getters and setters.
====

* Create an interface `fr.lernejo.todo.TodoRepository` annotated with `@Repository` and extending `CrudRepository<TodoEntity, Long>`

[NOTE]
====
Here the _magic_ of Spring will take place, the interface will have an implementation at runtime (no concrete class), and this is possible using a dynamic proxy.

All the methods of this interface allowing standard operations such as saving, deleting, listing, finding by an id, etc. will have a standard behavior without the need to code it.

This is the most advanced implementation of the *Generic DAO* pattern.
====

* Modify the `TodoListController` class to:
** Take as constructor parameter an object of type `TodoRepository`
** Use this repository in the existing methods, instead of the `ArrayList`
** Delete the `ArrayList` field, that has became useless

* Modify the `docker-compose.yml` file by adding a new service:

[source,yml]
----
postgres:
    image: postgres:14.0-alpine
    container_name: postgres
    ports:
      - 5432:5432
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: example
----

* Restart the build of the Docker image using `docker compose build`
* Start the various containers using the `docker compose up -d` command
* ✔️ Check that the API behaves consistently even if HTTP requests are served by different instances: http://localhost:80/app/api/todo
* Add and commit the changes
