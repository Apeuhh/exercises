= HTTP API using Spring: production and consumption
:hardbreaks-option:

Steps marked with ✔️ are verifications that all is working as expected and that you can keep running through the exercise.

The purpose of this project is to build HTTP APIs using JSON serialization:

* production: the code starts an HTTP server which serves specific requests
* consumption: the code calls a remote HTTP server

We will use:

* *Spring web-mvc* to handle the API from the server side
* *retrofit* as HTTP client

The theme of this project is to build the website of a travel agency which offers destinations, depending on the temperature difference with the user country.

== Simplified architecture

A second application must be developed. Its purpose will to to supply the average temperature of a country.

== Grading

Grading is affected by various points:

* The project compiles
* The project starts (method `fr.lernejo.travel.Launcher#main` must start an HTTP server on the 8080 port)
* The 2 APIs `POST /api/inscription` and `GET /api/travels` described further on:
** Are available
** Are in compliance with supplied JSON schemas
** Are consistent (a call to `GET /api/travels` right after the startup returns an empty list, because `POST /api/inscription` has not been called yet)
** Behave as expected (a call to `GET /api/travels` returns available *destinations* for the users already registered)
* The *GIT* history is clean and understandable
** All commit messages must have an _**intention**_
** No commits with the same message
** More information: https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/
* The code **Style** must allow easy reading
** Methods must be of 15 lines or less
** Code must not be minified (-8 penalty)
** Code must be properly formatted (Ctrl+Alt+l with IJ)
** Classes must of 80 lines maximum (-1 point de pénalité pour les écarts)
** No re-assignable fields (all field must be `final`)
** No static field or method (expect `main`)
* Continuous Integration is up and running
* Test coverage is > *80%*

A simple frontend (HTML, CSS, JS) is supplied.
You are free to modify it as you wish as the grade will not take it into account.

== Part 1 - Repository creation using a template

* On the template page https://github.com/lernejo/travel_agency_template, click on "Use this template"
* Fill in the repository name: **travel_agency**
* Check the repository as **private**
* Create the repository by clicking on "*Create repository from template*"
* Invite the current teacher as a read-only member
* Do not forget to update badges (follow
  -> https://github.com/lernejo/exercises/blob/master/maven_fr/EXERCISE.adoc#partie-6---live-badges)
* Clone this new repository using the *SSH URL*
* The default branch is *main*, and the project will be graded on this branch

[NOTE]
====
The supplied code consists of a multi-module Maven project, with two modules being the applications to create (`site` et `prediction-engine`).

The `site` application will start an HTTP server listening on 8080, whereas the second one will listen on 7080.
====

== Part 2 - JSON HTTP APIs

To make the http://localhost:8080/[frontend] usable, code two APIs in the *site* module:

* `POST /api/inscription` taking as body JSON document consistent with teh following schema:

[source,json]
----
{
    "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/schema#",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "userEmail": {
            "type": "string",
            "format": "email"
        },
        "userName": {
            "type": "string"
        },
        "userCountry": {
            "type": "string"
        },
        "weatherExpectation": {
            "type": "string",
            "enum": [
                "WARMER",
                "COLDER"
            ]
        },
        "minimumTemperatureDistance": {
          "type": "integer",
          "minimum": 0,
          "exclusiveMaximum": 40
        }
    },
    "required": [
        "userEmail",
        "userName",
        "userCountry",
        "weatherExpectation",
        "minimumTemperatureDistance"
    ]
}
----

For example:

[source,json]
----
{
    "userEmail": "machin@truc.com",
    "userName": "machin",
    "userCountry": "France",
    "weatherExpectation": "WARMER",
    "minimumTemperatureDistance": 20
}
----

* `GET /api/travels?userName={userName}` returning a list of available destinations, consistent with the following schema:

[source,json]
----
{
    "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/schema#",
    "type": "array",
    "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "country": {
                "type": "string"
            },
            "temperature": {
                "type": "number"
            }
        },
        "required": [
            "country",
            "temperature"
        ]
    }
}
----

For example:

[source,json]
----
[
    {
        "name": "Caribbean",
        "temperature": 32.4
    },
    {
        "name": "Australia",
        "temperature": 35.1
    }
]
----

Here you can return hardcoded or random data, the definitive behavior will use the *prediction-engine* depicted further on.

* ✔️ the supplied frontend (http://localhost:8080) works with fake data

== Part 3 - Prediction API

The code that loads temperatures for several countries is already present in the *prediction-engine* module.

* Code the HTTP API `GET /api/temperature?country={country}` returning a list of temperatures of the given country over the last 2 days, consistent with the following schema:

[source,json]
----
{
    "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/schema#",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "country": {
            "type": "string"
        },
        "temperatures": {
            "type": "array",
            "minItems": 2,
            "maxItems": 2,
            "items": {
              "type": "object",
              "properties": {
                "date": {
                  "type": "string",
                  "format": "date"
                },
                "temperature": {
                  "type": "number"
                }
              },
              "required": [
                  "date",
                  "temperature"
              ]
            }
        }
    },
    "required": [
        "country",
        "temperatures"
    ]
}
----

For example:

[source,json]
----
{
    "country": "France",
    "temperatures": [
        {
            "date": "2021-12-04",
            "temperature": 12
        },
        {
            "date": "2021-12-03",
            "temperature": 7
        }
    ]
}
----

When the country is not known to the API, it must return the HTTP code 417.

== Part 4 - HTTP client

* Add the following dependency to the *site* module: `com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.9.0`
* Create a new interface to query the *prediction-engine* API, use the official documentation: https://square.github.io/retrofit/
* Add this HTTP client as bean in the Spring context
** To this end, add a method such as the following in the `Launcher` class (considering that your interface is called `PredictionEngineClient`)

[source,java]
----
@Bean
PredictionEngineClient predictionEngineClient() {
    Retrofit retrofit = new Retrofit.Builder()
        .baseUrl("http://localhost:7080/")
        .build();

    return retrofit.create(PredictionEngineClient.class);
}
----

* ✔️ The application (`Launcher#main`) starts without error

== Part 5 - Put all the pieces together

The business of the application is simple, at each query of a user, load the *countries.txt* file available at the root of the classpath and, for every country, query the *prediction-engine* API.
Compute the temperature average for each country, then filter out those not satisfying to the user criteria (`weatherExpectation` and `minimumTemperatureDistance`).

[NOTE]
====
Loading the content of a file in the _classpath_ can be done this way:

[source,java]
----
try (InputStream inputStream = this.getClass().getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream("myfile.txt")) {
    String content = new String(resource.readAllBytes(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
    Stream<String> lines = content.lines();

    // ... rest of the code
}
----
====

* In the *site* module, create a new class annotated with `@Service` with methods needed to handle the two APIs data and containing the logic between these two APIs
** This class will take as constructor parameter an object of type `PredictionEngineClient`
** This class could be easily tested (with a Unit Test, a test class whose name ends with **Tests**) by creating a mock of `PredictionEngineClient`
* Use this service as parameter of the *controller* coded in **part 2** and replace the fake data by the use of this service
* Modify the Integration Test of the *controller* accordingly

* ✔️ The supplied frontend (http://localhost:8080) works as expected, the POC (Proof Of Concept) is complete!

== The End

You can go beyond if you like, mais you will only be graded on whats is previously described.
The APIs, if you were to change them should stay compatible with the supplied schemas.
Meaning:

* Fields can be added to answers
* Optional fields can be added to requests
* Existing fields must not be removed or renamed
